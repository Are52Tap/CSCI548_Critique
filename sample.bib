 abstract = {Causal networks are graphically represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Learning causal networks from data is a challenging problem due to the size of the space of DAGs, the acyclicity constraint placed on the graphical structures, and the presence of equivalence classes. In this article, we develop an L1-penalized likelihood approach to estimate the structure of causal Gaussian networks. A blockwise coordinate descent algorithm, which takes advantage of the acyclicity constraint, is proposed for seeking a local maximizer of the penalized likelihood. We establish that model selection consistency for causal Gaussian networks can be achieved with the adaptive lasso penalty and sufficient experimental interventions. Simulation and real data examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our method shows satisfactory performance for DAGs with 200 nodes, which have about 20,000 free parameters. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

abstract="In this paper, we present a distributed computing method, namely Sequential Bayesian Learning for modular neural networks. The method is based on the idea of sequential Bayesian decision analysis to gradually improving the decision accuracy by collecting more information derived from a series of experiments and determine the combination weights of each sub-network. One of the advantages of this method is it emulates humans' problems processing mode effectively and makes uses of old information while new data information is acquired at each stage. The results of experiments on eight regression problems show that the method is superior to simple averaging on those hard-to-learn problems.",
